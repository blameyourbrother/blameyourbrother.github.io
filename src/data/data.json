Based in Toronto, Ontario, we specialize in 2D classical and 2D/3D digital animation along with developing intellectual property for commercial and broadcast clients.</p><p>Our goal is to create compelling and entertaining work by combining the power of design with a story-driven message. Since we're an artist-owned shop, we also bring a personal touch to every project that walks through our door.</p><p>Though we're a locally-based shop, we've been lucky to build contacts that have a global reach. They're contacts that have been developed through years of working in the animation and advertising communities.</p>",
